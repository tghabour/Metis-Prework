# Learning Objectives

### Advanced Python Data Types
The students will:

* Be familiar with default dictionaries, named tuples, and deques
* Understand the difference between a list and a generator
* Be familiar with `yield` vs `return` and the purpose of generators
* Be exposed to the basics of computational complexity

### Deep Copy

The students will:

* Understand how the memory is assigned (roughly)
* Understand why deep copy is necessary
* Know how to deep copy and recognize when it is needed

### Pickle: Saving Objects for Later

The students will:

* Know what pickling is
* Understand how to dump/load an object
* Be familiar with how pickle can fit into their workflow

### Complexity

The students will:

* Be exposed to the basics of computational complexity
* Become familiar with the concepts of Big-O notation
