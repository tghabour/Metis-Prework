# Complexity

An algorithm's complexity is a measure of the resources it uses.  We care about the amount of memory an algorithm requires (space complexity), but most commonly, we discuss complexity we are referring to the time it takes an algorithm to run (time complexity).

We will discuss computational complexity in much more detail during the bootcamp, but now let's get started with a few resources about Big-O notation.

Big-O notation is used to classify the worst-case "speed" of an algorithm by looking at the order of magnitude of execution time. Read through the following to get a sense of what Big-O notation is and why it matters:
